In this repository how to code a multiprocessing stations with help of Siemens plc (TIA Portal)-S71500 and MATLAB.
In this projects, you will program a Siemens PLC. For this you will need three programs that are part of the Siemens TIA Portal (system requirement: Windows 7 or Windows 10 64-bit) :
TIA Portal (STEP 7): Programming environment. You can visit Siemens website to download and choose particular version.
PLCSIM Advanced: virtual PLC DOWNLOAD 
SIMIT: simulation software  (Installation of SIMIT SP sufficient)
Automation Licence Manager: Software licence management - is automatically installed as well.
PLCSIM Advanced and SIMIT allow you to implement the project at home with a simulated PLC and a simulated plant.
